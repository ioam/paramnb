# ParamNB

Generate ipywidgets from [Parameterized](https://github.com/ioam/param) objects in a Jupyter notebook.

See the demo notebooks 
[doc/index.ipynb](https://anaconda.org/jbednar/paramnb), [doc/AdditionalFeatures.ipynb](https://anaconda.org/cball/paramnb-additional_features), and 
[doc/JSONInit.ipynb](https://anaconda.org/jbednar/jsoninit)
for examples.  Those links go to static version of the notebooks 
hosted on Anaconda Cloud, but after looking at them it's best to try
them out yourself interactively!

You can easily install paramnb using conda:

```
conda install -c ioam paramnb
```

or pip:

```
pip install paramnb
```
