    "[ParamNB](https://github.com/ioam/paramnb) is a small library that represents Parameters graphically in a Jupyter notebook.  Parameters are Python attributes extended using the [Param library](https://github.com/ioam/param) to support types, ranges, and documentation, which turns out to be just the information you need to automatically create widgets for each parameter.  ParamNB currently uses [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io) to display the widgets, but the design of Param and ParamNB allows your code to be completely independent of the underlying widgets library, and ParamNB can be updated to use other widget libraries as they are developed without needing changes in your code.\n",

If you later want to display the hidden parameters, e.g. for debugging, you can change the `display_threshold` parameter, e.g. by supplying it to the `Widgets()` call. Parameters with the same precedence are sorted alphanumerically, in groups sorted by the precedence value.  Values with no declared precedence are given a very low precedence by default (`Widgets(...,default_precedence=1e-8)`), allowing you to force parameters to appear at the top of the list by giving them a precedence of zero (or another very small number).\n",

That way your main code can be fully independent of any GUI or notebook display, while your notebooks can easily expose the parameters declared in your main code, without duplicating their names or definitions and without relying on any specific details of that code.  So you can now have full interactivity without tying yourself to any particular user interface or GUI library, and without tying your user interface code to details of your domain-specific code.\n",
