    "[ParamNB](https://github.com/ioam/paramnb) is a small library that represents Parameters graphically in a Jupyter notebook.  Parameters are Python attributes extended using the [Param library](https://github.com/ioam/param) to support types, ranges, and documentation, which turns out to be just the information you need to automatically create widgets for each parameter.  ParamNB currently uses [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io) to display the widgets, but the design of Param and ParamNB allows your code to be completely independent of the underlying widgets library, and ParamNB can be updated to use other widget libraries as they are developed without needing changes in your code.\n",

    "* `continuous_update=True`: the specified code is executed for every movement of a slider\n",
    "* `continuous_update=False`: the default; the specified code is executed only once a widget has been released\n",

    "These options allow you to choose between various levels of dynamic interactivity, as appropriate for the computational and semantic requirements of the code you are executing.  Rough guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `button=False,continuous_update=True`: Provides a smooth, dynamic user experience, with text or plots updating immediately as a slider is dragged. Appropriate only for inexpensive operations, where rexecuting the code multiple times on the fly is not an issue.\n",
    "* `button=False,continuous_update=False`: The default; a good middle ground appropriate for most interactive use, with relatively responsive interactivity, updating each time a widget is released.  Suitable for relatively expensive operations, but not so expensive that it is problematic to have them run once for each widget adjusted.\n",

You can thus hide values that are not useful in the notebook by giving the parameters a negative precedence when they are declared.  If you later want to display the hidden parameters, e.g. for debugging, you can change the `display_threshold` parameter, e.g. by supplying it to the `Widgets()` call. Parameters with the same precedence are sorted alphanumerically, in groups sorted by the precedence value.  Values with no declared precedence are given a very low precedence by default (`Widgets(...,default_precedence=1e-8)`), allowing you to force parameters to appear at the top of the list by giving them a precedence of zero (or another very small number).\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, all these features make it simple to add interactive controls in Jupyter notebooks: just declare your parameters wherever their values will need to be used, using the Param library (pure Python, zero dependencies), then add an optional `Widgets()` declaration in your notebook wherever you want to be able to modify those values interactively.  That way your main code can be fully independent of any GUI or notebook display, while your notebooks can easily expose the parameters declared in your main code, without duplicating their names or definitions and without relying on any specific details of that code.  So you can now have full interactivity without tying yourself to any particular user interface or GUI library, and without tying your user interface code to details of your domain-specific code.\n",
